**Working memory delayed match to sample experimental paradigm**

In the single-trial paradigm, participants encode three shapes in a specific spatiotemporal sequence in preparation for a self-paced match/mismatch recognition test of sequences that match exactly or mismatch on one dimension. It is intended for humans aged 13+ years with healthy cognitive function and normal/corrected-to-normal vision. It was designed for studies using intracranial and scalp EEG.
